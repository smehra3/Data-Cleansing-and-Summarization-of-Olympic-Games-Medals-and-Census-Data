# Data Cleansing and Summarization of Olympic Games Medals and Census Data

Performed basic data cleaning on the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and then summarized information.

Used census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov) and derived summary.
