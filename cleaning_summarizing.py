# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[2]:


# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[86]:


def answer_one():
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='Gold', ascending=False)
    return sorted_df.index[0]


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[87]:


def answer_two():
    df['difference_summer_winter_gold']=[df['Gold'][n]-df['Gold.1'][n] for n in df.index]
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='difference_summer_winter_gold', ascending=False)
    return sorted_df.index[0]


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[51]:


def answer_three():
    df_consider=df[(df['Gold.1'] >=1) & (df['Gold'] >=1)]
    df_consider['difference_summer_winter_gold']=[(df_consider['Gold'][n]-df_consider['Gold.1'][n])/df_consider['Gold'][n] 
                                                  for n in df_consider.index]
    sorted_df = df_consider.sort_values(by='difference_summer_winter_gold', ascending=False)
    return sorted_df.index[0]


# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[43]:


def answer_four():
    df['points']=[3*(df['Gold.2'][n])+(2*df['Silver.2'][n])+df['Bronze.2'][n] for n in df.index]
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='points', ascending=False)
    return sorted_df['points']


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[33]:


census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()


# In[42]:


def answer_five():
    return census_df['STNAME'].value_counts().argmax()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[53]:


def answer_six():
    counties_pop = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby(['STNAME']).sum()['CENSUS2010POP']
    sorted_counties_by_pop = counties_pop.to_frame().sort_values(by='CENSUS2010POP', ascending=False)
    return list(sorted_counties_by_pop.index[0:3])


# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[37]:


def answer_seven():
    census_df_alt = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    census_df_alt['max_pop']=[max(census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2010'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2011'][n],
                              census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2012'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2013'][n],
                              census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2014'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2015'][n])
                          for n in census_df_alt.index]
    census_df_alt['min_pop']=[min(census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2010'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2011'][n],
                              census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2012'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2013'][n],
                              census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2014'][n],census_df_alt['POPESTIMATE2015'][n])
                          for n in census_df_alt.index]
    census_df_alt['max_diff_pop']=[census_df_alt['max_pop'][n]-census_df_alt['min_pop'][n] for n in census_df_alt.index]
    sorted_max_diff_pop = census_df_alt.sort_values(by='max_diff_pop', ascending=False)
    return sorted_max_diff_pop.iloc[0]['CTYNAME']
answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[30]:


def answer_eight():
    filtered = census_df[census_df.REGION.isin([1,2])& 
              census_df.CTYNAME.str.startswith('Washington')][['STNAME', 'CTYNAME','POPESTIMATE2015','POPESTIMATE2014']]
    filtered['greaterthan2014']=[filtered['POPESTIMATE2015'][n]>census_df['POPESTIMATE2014'][n] for n in filtered.index]
    further_filtered = filtered[filtered.greaterthan2014.eq(True)]
    return further_filtered[['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']]
